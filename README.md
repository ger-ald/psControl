**Logging usage:**
1. Click `More>>` to show the extended functionality
2. Set the interval or do this while it's logging<br>
<sup>Set to '0' to log as fast as update rate but note that not all csv tools handle this correctly when reading the logged csv</sup>
3. Click `Start log`, choose a filename and open<br>
<sup>The filename is `psuLog_<yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss>.csv` by default</sup>

**Scripting usage:**
1. Click `More>>` to show the extended functionality
2. Click the button with the file icon (![BrowseIcon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10982994/107150805-fd745000-695f-11eb-96b5-9efbd644f659.png))<br>
3. A file browse window will pop-up where you can pick the script file to open<br>

5. Click the play button again (now a pause icon) to pause the running script or the button with the stop icon to stop the script. Clicking play after stop or script finish will reload the script from disk.<br>

**Known issues:**<br>
-After changing comport numbers in device explorer, psControl will not be able to connect to that port until after a reboot.<br>
-you can still adjust the output when running a script. (wich is dangerous when using v++ or i++ in the script)<br>
-script syntax errors are not displayed
