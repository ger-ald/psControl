//a line starting with anything other than a known command will be regarded as comment
//whitespace (spaces or tabs) in front of a command will be ignored and the cmd executed
//a command and its parameters need to be separated with spaces or tabs

//all lines in the file will be evaluated and commands executed from the first to the last
//when evaluation comes to the last line the script is stopped



//known commands:

//set voltage to 12.34V
v 12.34

//set current to 1.234A
i 1.234

//set voltage to 1.00A
v 1

//increment voltage by 1V
v++

//increment voltage by 0.42V
v++ 0.42

//decrement works too, and also for current

//you can also set current and voltage with one command (0.2V 0.1A)
